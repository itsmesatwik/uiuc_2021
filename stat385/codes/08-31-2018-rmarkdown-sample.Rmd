# Intro

This document is arrange in two different ways. The first way is an "interactive" portion that will be done live in lecture. The second portion contains worked examples from the lecture slides. You can navigate the document by using the table of contents.

Inline math $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

Display math (centered math) $$1 - x = y$$

Creating a Table

```{r, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
# This code chunk creates the img directory and downloads the block-i.png to it.

# We're hiding it from the report using echo = FALSE
dir.create("img")
download.file("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Illinois_Block_I.png/414px-Illinois_Block_I.png", "img/block-i.png")
```

Let's hide the _R_ code from showing up in the report!

```{r ex-hide, echo = FALSE} 
x = 1:10
y = 11:20
plot(x, y)
```

It's ideal to compute values inside of a code chunk and then reference 
variables from _R_ inline.

```{r calc-values, echo = FALSE} 
# 
x = 1:10
x_mu = mean(x)
x_sd = sd(x)
``` 

The _mean_ of **x** is  `r x_mu`  and the _standard deviation_ is `r x_sd` .

We can also supply a pure expression: `r 2 + 3`.
